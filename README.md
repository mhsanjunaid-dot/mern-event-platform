Concurrency + Capacity Logic (Explanation)
This app prevents over-booking using atomic MongoDB updates inside RSVP routes.

Example logic:
await Event.findOneAndUpdate(
  { _id: eventId, attendees: { $ne: userId }, $expr: { $lt: [{ $size: "$attendees" }, "$capacity"] }},
  { $addToSet: { attendees: userId }},
  { new: true }
);

What this solves:
- User cannot RSVP twice
- User cannot exceed event capacity
- Two people cannot take the last spot at the same time

This ensures:
✔ data integrity
✔ zero race conditions
✔ accurate participant count
